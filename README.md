## Project Reflection

### Designing Software

#### Approach to Design
My approach to software design involves meticulous planning and analysis. I begin by outlining the core functionalities and architectural components required. This project honed my skills in designing modular and scalable software systems.

#### Design Skills Gained
Working on this project enabled me to craft new skills in designing flexible and extensible software architectures. I learned to emphasize modularity and abstraction while creating software, facilitating easier maintenance and extension.

#### Design Process Followed
Throughout this project, I followed a structured design process. I started with requirement analysis, proceeded to system design, and then implemented the design iteratively while ensuring adaptability to potential changes.

#### Application in Future Work
The tactics from my design approach, emphasizing modularity and adaptability, will be invaluable in future projects. They will enable quicker iterations, easier maintenance, and the incorporation of new features seamlessly.

### Developing Programs

#### Approach to Development
In developing the 3D scene, I adopted new strategies such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and agile development methodologies. This allowed for a more organized and iterative development process.

#### Role of Iteration
Iteration played a crucial role in the project's development. Each iteration brought refinements and improvements. It enabled me to rectify issues, enhance functionalities, and gradually achieve the desired outcome.

#### Evolution in Development Approach
My approach evolved significantly from the initial milestones to the project's completion. I transitioned from a more linear development process to a more iterative and agile approach, focusing on continuous improvements.

### Computer Science and Future Goals

#### Educational Pathway
Computational graphics and visualizations expanded my knowledge in handling complex graphical concepts. These skills will be invaluable in my educational pathway by enhancing my abilities to comprehend and manipulate complex data structures.

#### Professional Pathway
In my professional journey, computational graphics and visualizations offer a competitive edge. They equip me with skills in data visualization, computer graphics, and simulation, essential in various domains like game development, data analysis, and virtual reality.
